    "The `MultistepNNIntegrator` class is used to implement a neural network based integrator with a $S$-step method. This is integrating a given $d$-dimensional system $\\frac{dq(t)}{dt}=\\mathcal{N}(q(t))$. The underlying neural model implements the mapping\n",

    "Alternatively, the `HamiltonianVerletNNIntegrator` implements a single-step Stoermer-Verlet method for a Hamiltonian system, following the ideas in [https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01563](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01563).
